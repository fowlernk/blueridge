Blue Ridge Parkway Map
===
A few years ago, my father and step-mother had some trouble finding areas in which they could take my step-grandfather to go see waterfalls or different views. He was a man who loved the outdoors, but he had trouble getting around towards the end of his life. I created a map that showcases various handicap accessible places along the Blue Ridge Parkway.

I made this map by searching through areas off of and near the Blue Ridge Parkway on Google Maps. I would find a hiking trail or facility and then search information about it in which I would deem it either simply a foot trail, or a handicap accessible area. I was inspired by both the story mentioned previously, and by [this article](https://www.wta.org/news/magazine/features/helping-disabled-people-find-belonging-outdoors).
